# Devtools

A development tool component that provides insights into the AI-generated code and its execution.

## Description:

The Devtools component renders a UI at the bottom of your application, offering valuable debugging and development information. It displays:

- **Files Created:** A list of all files generated by the AI, allowing you to inspect the generated code.
- **Status:** The execution status of the AI-generated code, indicating whether it was `successful`, `pending`, or encountered an `error`.
- **Input JSON:** The JSON representation of the input data sent to the AI model, including prompts and supporting properties.
- **Model Thoughts and Expectations:** The AI model's internal reasoning and expected actions on user end, providing insights into its decision-making process.
- **Refresh Response:** A button to regenerate the AI's response, useful for testing different prompts or debugging issues.
- **Error Details:** If an error occurs, the Devtools displays the error `message`, `status`, detailed error information, and `error code`.
