### Transform your React applications with AI-powered, prompt-driven components.

## What is Intelligent React Components?

Intelligent React Components is a library that bridges the gap between traditional React development and AI capabilities. It enhances standard HTML elements like buttons, forms, and inputs by integrating them with AI functionality, creating a seamless development experience that lets you harness the power of AI without leaving your React workflow.

## How It Works

The library takes familiar React components and supercharges them with AI capabilities:

1. You provide a prompt describing the desired functionality
2. The component sends the prompt to an AI model such as Gemini API.
3. The AI generates code based on your instructions
4. The library pre-processes the response and creates all necessary files
5. Event handlers and initialization functions are automatically attached

## Features

1. ### 🧠 Prompt-Driven Development

Write natural language prompts to describe what you want your component to do:

```jsx
<AIButton 
  prompt="When clicked, fetch user data from the API and display it in a formatted table"
  filename="fetchUserData"
  listener="onClick"
>
  Load Users
</AIButton>
```

2. ### 🔄 Codebase Integration
The library can interact with your existing code, including:

React state variables
Functions and callbacks
Database operations
Environment variables

3. ### 🔥 Cloud-base Databases Integration
Built-in support for Firebase and Supabase operations.

4. ### 🔄 State Management
Easily update React state based on AI-generated logic.

5. ### 🪝 Callback System
Execute your own functions when specific conditions are met.
