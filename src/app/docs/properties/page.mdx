# Component Properties

This section details all the properties that can be used with Intelligent React Components. Understanding these properties is key to use the full power of prompt-driven React components.

## Overview

Intelligent React Components provides several enhanced HTML elements that are powered by AI capabilities. Each component accepts a set of properties that control its behavior, appearance, and interaction with the AI backend.
The properties are organized into:

- **Common Properties:** Shared across all AI components
- **Component-Specific Properties:** Unique to each component type

## Property Categories

### Common Properties

All AI components share a core set of properties that define how they interact with the AI, process prompts, and integrate with your application. These include properties for prompt definition, event handling and integration with your codebase.

### Component-Specific Properties

In addition to common properties, each component type has its own specific properties that customize its behavior.

## Property Types

Each property is documented with:

- **Type**: The expected data type (string, function, object, etc.)
- **Required/Optional**: Whether the property must be provided
- **Default Value**: The default value (if any)
- **Description**: What the property does and how to use it
- **Examples**: Code examples showing the property in use
