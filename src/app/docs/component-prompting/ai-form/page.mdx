# Prompt Engineering for Effective Form Generation: A Guide

Here's what the `AIForm` is telling you!

Hi! I'm here to help you build amazing forms, but I need your help too! The clearer and more specific your instructions are, the better I can understand your needs and deliver a form that's just right. Here's a guide on how to prompt me effectively:

**1. Be Specific About the Form's Purpose**

*   **Do:** Start with the main goal of the form. Tell me what it's for.

    *   Example: 'Create a contact form for a website' or 'Build a registration form for a conference.'
*   **Don't:** Be vague. Avoid prompts like 'Make a form' without specifying its objective.

**2. Clearly Define Each Field**

*   **Do:** Be explicit about each field you need. Include:

    *   **Label:** What should the user see next to the field?
    *   **Type:** Is it text, email, number, a dropdown, a checkbox, a file upload?
    *   **Validation:** What rules should apply (required, valid email, minimum length, etc.)?
    *   **Example:** 'A field for 'Full Name' (text, required), an 'Email Address' field (email, required, valid email format), a 'Message' field (textarea)'

*   **Don't:** Just say 'Include a name field' without specifying the type or validation.

**3. Give Context for Layout and Styling**

*   **Do:** Provide guidance on how the form should look and be arranged.

    *   **Layout:** 'One-column layout', 'Two-column layout', or descriptions like 'Name and email side-by-side.'
    *   **Style Hints:** 'Modern design', 'Use Material Design', or 'Clean, professional look with subtle borders.'
    *   **Color Palette:** If you have specific colors in mind, list them (e.g., 'Use this color palette: #FFA725, #FFF5E4, #C1D8C3').

*   **Don't:** Leave it entirely up to me without any stylistic direction.

**4. Handling Multi-Step Forms**

*   **Do:** Clearly outline the steps, titles, fields in each step, and descriptions.

    *   Example:

    ```
    Multi-step form with:
    Step 1: "Personal Information" (fields: name, email, phone)
    Step 2: "Address" (fields: address, city, postal code)
    Step 3: "Preferences" (fields: newsletter, interests)
    ```

*   **Don't:** Assume I'll know the best way to divide the form without instructions.

**5. Database Integration**

*   **Do:** If the form interacts with a database, specify:

    *   **Database Type:** 'Firebase', 'Supabase', etc.
    *   **Collection/Table Name:** 'Insert data into the 'users' table.'
    *   **Environment Variables:** Instructions like 'Use NEXT\_PUBLIC\_SUPABASE\_URL and NEXT\_PUBLIC\_SUPABASE\_ANON\_KEY.'
    *   **Data Handling:** 'Calculate salePrice by applying the discount to the original price'

*   **Don't:** Just say 'Connect to a database' without details.

**6. Dynamic Behavior and Dependencies**

*   **Do:** Explain any dynamic changes:

    *   'If 'Round Trip' is selected, show the return date field.'
    *   'Enable the 'Last Name' field only if the 'First Name' field is filled.'

*   **Don't:** Expect me to infer complex logic without being told.

**7. Understand My Key Words**

*   `fetch`: Indicates fetching data from the database.
*   `insert`: Indicates inserting data into the database.
*   `update`: Indicates updating data in the database.
*   `delete`: Indicates deleting data from the database.

**8. Examples of Good and Bad Prompts**

*   **Bad:** 'Create a form for users.' (Too vague)
*   **Good:** 'Create a user registration form with fields for 'First Name' (text, required), 'Last Name' (text, required), 'Email Address' (email, required, valid email format), and 'Password' (password, required, minimum 8 characters). Use a clean, modern design.'

*   **Bad:** 'Make a multi-step form.' (Lacks details)
*   **Good:** 'Create a 2-step form. Step 1: 'Personal Info' (fields: name, email). Step 2: 'Preferences' (fields: newsletter, interests). Validate each step.'

**9. Key Things to Remember**

*   **type:** Enums which indicate what type of HTML tag the form field should have for every field.
*   **filename:** This tag determines the general style of the component and to prevent CSS collisions.
*   Be aware of keys like multiStep, fieldDefinitions, and listener and how they interact. The more you utilize them the better I can interpret your requirements.

**10. What About Me?**

*   `helperFunction`: A function which needs the use in main function.
*   `globals`: if a variable is in formBuilder and needs to use later always save to global.
*   `CSS`: proper style following conventions.

By following these guidelines, you'll be able to write prompts that allow me to generate exactly the form you need!
